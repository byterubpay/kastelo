# RFC-HWALLET-1 DEVELOPER EDITION DISCLAIMER 20181200

## 1. STATUS

RFC-HWALLET-1 development team (“HWDT”) is a loose collective of individuals with an aim of developing an Open Source printed circuit board design for a dedicated ByteRub hardware wallet. There is no centralized authority, entity, or institution that controls, dictates, regulates, or makes decisions for, or on behalf of, any member of the collective. It is not the intent of HWDT to form any partnership, joint venture, agency, employer-employee or fiduciary relationship.

## 2. DELIVERY

HWDT delivers a Development Package (“DP”) that includes evaluation boards, components, and/or documentation to developers (“Users”), who are qualified technicians familiar with handling electrical and mechanical components. Users voluntarily and knowingly assume the risks associated with handling such components, which could potentially lead to shock, fire, serious injury, and/or damage to property. Users undertake to take all necessary measures to minimize these risks. The DP is an unfinished product intended to be used for experimentation in a controlled research and development setting. The DP may not be sold for consumer or commercial use.

## 3. DISCLAIMER

The DP is provided “as is” and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use are disclaimed. HWDT makes no representation that DP, does or will not infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. Users warrant that they do not act in a consumer capacity.

## 4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

HWDT shall have no liability, neither jointly nor severally, for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages of any character including, without limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the DP. Users shall hold HWDT free and harmless from any and all liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties.

## 5. SANCTIONS

Users acknowledge that the DP may include technology subject to sanctions, embargoes, or export control regulations and shall undertake to ensure compliance with any applicable laws.

## 6. CUSTOMS

The DP is intended to be used exclusively for testing to find out components’ composition, quality or other characteristics for information, or for industrial or commercial research. Users may be able to import DP free from duty, excise duty and VAT in some countries, but should consult with the appropriate local authorities on how to obtain relief. Normally, Users must completely use up or destroy goods in the course of the testing to qualify for relief.

## 7. EVALUATION TOKENS

Some devices may include evaluation tokens. These tokens exist in a test network (“testnet”), which is separate from the main ByteRub network and subject to network resets at any time. As such, said tokens do not contain any value. Testnet addresses are identified by an address prefix that start with A, B, or 9.
